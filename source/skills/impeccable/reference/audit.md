> Modified for Project Blueprints: instruction-only adaptation; upstream runtime automation is not installed.

Run systematic **technical** quality checks and generate a comprehensive report. Don't fix issues; document them for other commands to address.

This is a code-level audit, not a design critique. Check what's measurable and verifiable in the implementation.

**Web UI scope.** Native platform wrappers are not included. Use the project's own platform guidance for other surfaces.

## Diagnostic Scan

Inspect the named target across these dimensions using available, authorized evidence. Score a dimension only when its relevant states were actually inspected; otherwise mark it not inspected, explain the gap and omit it from the denominator. Scores are diagnostic judgments, not certification. Theme/mobile requirements apply only when the product supports them; do not add features merely to improve a score.

### 1. Accessibility (A11y)

**Check for**:
- **Contrast issues**: Text contrast ratios < 4.5:1, or < 3:1 for large text (or 7:1 for AAA)
- **Motion sensitivity**: `prefers-reduced-motion` needs an intentional alternative that preserves state change and hierarchy; flag a global `0.01ms` kill that destroys useful feedback, flashing above threshold, and motion that blocks focus, reading, or task completion
- **Missing ARIA**: Interactive elements without proper roles, labels, or states
- **Keyboard navigation**: Missing focus indicators, illogical tab order, keyboard traps
- **Semantic HTML**: Improper heading hierarchy, missing landmarks, divs instead of buttons
- **Alt text**: Missing or poor image descriptions
- **Form issues**: Inputs without labels, poor error messaging, missing required indicators

**Score 0-4**: 0=Primary paths inaccessible, 1=Major checked gaps, 2=Partial coverage with significant checked gaps, 3=Good checked coverage with minor gaps, 4=Strong checked coverage. This heuristic is not a WCAG conformance claim.

### 2. Performance

**Check for**:
- **Layout thrashing**: Reading/writing layout properties in loops
- **Expensive animations**: Casual layout-property animation, unbounded blur/filter/shadow effects, or effects that visibly drop frames
- **Missing optimization**: Images without lazy loading, unoptimized assets
- **will-change overuse**: `will-change` applied broadly or left on at rest (it is a targeted hint for known expensive animations, not a baseline requirement)
- **Bundle size**: Unnecessary imports, unused dependencies
- **Render performance**: Unnecessary re-renders, expensive repeated work demonstrated by inspection or measurement (not missing memoization alone)

**Score 0-4**: 0=Severe issues (layout thrash, unoptimized everything), 1=Major problems (no lazy loading, expensive animations), 2=Partial (some optimization, gaps remain), 3=Good (mostly optimized, minor improvements possible), 4=Excellent (fast, lean, well-optimized)

### 3. Theming

**Check for**:
- **Hard-coded colors**: Colors not using design tokens
- **Supported-theme defects**: Missing variants or poor contrast in a theme the product actually supports
- **Inconsistent tokens**: Using wrong tokens, mixing token types
- **Theme switching issues**: Values that don't update on theme change

**Score 0-4**: 0=No theming (hard-coded everything), 1=Minimal tokens (mostly hard-coded), 2=Partial (tokens exist but inconsistently used), 3=Good (tokens used, minor hard-coded values), 4=Excellent (coherent tokens and verified supported-theme behavior)

### 4. Responsive Design

**Check for**:
- **Fixed widths**: Hard-coded widths that break on mobile
- **Touch targets**: Interactive elements < 44x44px. WCAG AA (SC 2.5.8) requires at least 24x24 CSS px unless an exception applies: spacing, an equivalent control, inline text, user-agent styling, or an essential size. Spacing passes when a 24 CSS px circle centered on the target's bounding box overlaps no other target and no other undersized target's circle
- **Broken touch interaction**: Custom sliders, drag surfaces, and scrollable control strips whose primary gesture fails under touch, that swallow page scroll or lose the drag to it, or that stay stuck after an interrupted gesture. Code tells: mouse-only handlers, no `touch-action` on a pointer-event drag surface, drag state that nothing clears on cancel, lost capture, or blur. Exercise the gesture when a browser tool can synthesize touch (a rendered viewport proves layout, not the gesture), then say what produced the evidence (emulated viewport, synthesized touch, which engine, physical device) and what stayed untested
- **Horizontal scroll**: Content overflow on narrow viewports
- **Text scaling**: Layouts that break when text size increases
- **Missing breakpoints**: No mobile/tablet variants

**Score 0-4**: 0=Desktop-only (breaks on mobile), 1=Major issues (some breakpoints, many failures), 2=Partial (works on mobile, rough edges), 3=Good (responsive, minor touch target or overflow issues), 4=Excellent (fluid, all viewports, proper touch targets, gestures work under touch)

### 5. Implementation Integrity (CRITICAL)

Manually inspect the source and, when authorized, the rendered target. Check repeated implementation
shortcuts, token/component drift, misleading or decorative content, and a structure interchangeable with an
unrelated product. Verify each finding in context and separate code evidence from visual judgment.
The upstream detector, CDP scan and browser overlay are not installed; do not run, simulate or report them.

**Score 0-4**: 0=systemic drift, 1=major repeated failures, 2=several verified issues, 3=minor isolated issues, 4=coherent and intentional

## Generate Report

### Audit Health Score

| # | Dimension | Score | Key Finding |
|---|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Accessibility | ? | [most critical a11y issue or "--"] |
| 2 | Performance | ? | |
| 3 | Theming | ? | |
| 4 | Responsive Design | ? | |
| 5 | Implementation Integrity | ? | |
| **Total** | | **[score]/[inspected maximum]** | **[Rating band]** |

**Rating bands** for fully inspected dimensions: 90%+ Excellent, 70%+ Good, 50%+ Acceptable, 30%+ Poor, below 30% Critical. Always show coverage and gaps; no score alone establishes release readiness.

### Implementation Integrity Verdict
**Start here.** Pass/fail: does the implementation express a coherent product-specific system? Cite verified source/render evidence and state what was not inspected.

### Executive Summary
- Audit Health Score: **[score]/[inspected maximum]** ([rating band])
- Total issues found (count by severity: P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Top 3-5 critical issues
- Recommended next steps

### Detailed Findings by Severity

Tag every issue with **P0-P3 severity**:
- **P0 Blocking**: Prevents task completion. Fix immediately
- **P1 Major**: Significant difficulty or WCAG AA violation. Fix before release
- **P2 Minor**: Annoyance, workaround exists. Fix in next pass
- **P3 Polish**: Nice-to-fix, no real user impact. Fix if time permits

For each issue, document:
- **[P?] Issue name**
- **Location**: Component, file, line
- **Category**: Accessibility / Performance / Theming / Responsive / Implementation Integrity
- **Impact**: How it affects users
- **WCAG/Standard**: Which standard it violates (if applicable)
- **Recommendation**: How to fix it
- **Next action**: Smallest repair within scope; use a supported workflow only when it actually fits.

### Patterns & Systemic Issues

Identify recurring problems that indicate systemic gaps rather than one-off mistakes:
- "Hard-coded colors appear in 15+ components, should use design tokens"
- "Touch targets consistently too small (<44px) throughout mobile experience"

### Positive Findings

Note what's working well: good practices to maintain and replicate.

## Recommended Actions

List recommended commands in priority order (P0 first, then P1, then P2):

1. **[P?] `$command-name`**: Brief description (specific context from audit findings)
2. **[P?] `$command-name`**: Brief description (specific context)

Recommend only supported audit, critique, harden or polish workflows, or a concrete project-native action.
Do not edit during an audit or require another permission handoff for work already authorized elsewhere.

Keep P3s few: a long tail of minor issues buries the ones that matter.

**Avoid**:
- Report issues without explaining impact (why does this matter?)
- Provide generic recommendations (be specific and actionable)
- Skip positive findings (celebrate what works)
- Forget to prioritize (everything can't be P0)
- Report false positives without verification
